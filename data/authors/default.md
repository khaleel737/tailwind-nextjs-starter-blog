Hey, I'm Khaleel (Krypton Name Kal.eel like superman). I'm a Software Engineer seeking a job in a talented team with a plus side of working in Fintech, I have a thing for fintech, but hey if you have something interesting then by all means please do reach out, I'm a Full Stack web developer with knowledge in reactjs, nodejs and all things lovable with .js extension. I'm passionate about frontend development and backend as well, Ive started with mobile development recently specially in Swift and Im slowly by slowly falling in love with the language (side note: it took me less than 2 months to learn swift and advance mobile architecture then wrote 70,000+ SLOC for a trading app).

I like learning, commonsense and enjoying the peace that solving bugs bring, Its somehow a new religion where I pray to all live servers to hopefully deploy peacefully but sometimes it comes with a test from above (I mean cloud computing).
